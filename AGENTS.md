# Repository Guidelines for Junior's Awesome List

When modifying `README.md`:

1. Update the total website count in the document title, e.g. `# Junior's Awesome List of Top Websites (111 websites)`.
2. Update the site count shown in each category header, e.g. `## AI & LLM Platforms (30 websites)`.
3. Keep sites in alphabetical order within each category and avoid duplicates across categories.
4. List each site using `- Name â€“ https://example.com/` with a one-line description on the next line wrapped in `<small></small>`.
5. Update the table of contents whenever categories are added or removed.
6. Record all changes in the **Changelog** section. Each entry should start with `-` and be wrapped in `<small></small>`. If multiple changes occur on the same date, use multiple bullet lines.
7. Commit changes with a short summary.

These instructions apply to the entire repository.
