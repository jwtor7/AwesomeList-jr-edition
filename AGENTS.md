# Repository Guidelines for Junior's Awesome List

When modifying `README.md`:

1. Update the total website count in the document title. The title looks like `# Junior's Awesome List of Top Websites (117 websites)`.
2. Update the site count shown in each category header, e.g. `## AI & LLM Platforms (33 websites)`.
3. Record all changes in the **Changelog** section. Each entry should be a bullet line starting with `-` and wrapped in `<small></small>`. If multiple changes happen on the same date, use separate bullet lines beneath the same date.
4. Commit the changes with a short summary.

These instructions apply to the entire repository.
